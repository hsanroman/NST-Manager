# Nest Manager (Unofficial)

#####IMPORTANT: **Nest Automations has been merged into Nest Manager in a way that they are still 2 seperate apps but under one code base.  As such it will require you to remove your existing automations before upgrading.**

### Nest Manager App
This is the "***unofficial***" SmartThings user created SmartApp and Device handlers.
The SmartApp and Device Handlers work together to provide integration to the SmartThings ecosystem using Nest's Official API.

### Nest Automations App
This is a Child-SmartApp that allows you to creat different types of automations for your HVAC systems.

## What's New
***Manager App:***

 * **NEW**: Merged Manager and Automations into one codebase but it is still two apps... Thanks @ady264"
 * **NEW**: Thermostat ST Mode TempSetpoint Automation to select your thermostats and each mode to use for that thermostat and then choose the heat/cool setpoints for each mode. This is completely dynamic and will allow different setpoints for each thermostat selected.
 * **NEW**: Remote Sensors now allows selection of switches to run along with the thermostat to help with comfort. This support includes automation detection of devices that support 3-speeds, and allows setting speed based on individual threshold temps.
 * **ADDED**: Ability to Disable each automations individually.
 * **ADDED**: You can now receive Local Weather Alerts push notifications when the Nest Weather device is installed.
 * **UPDATED**: There is new install setup now that flows much better and allows display of the important available options better to users.
 * **UPDATED**: Device data updates have been modified to be much more efficient. All necessary data is sent at once eliminating the need for the devices to call back to the manager app constantly.
 * **NEW**: Analytics have been added to the app to share very basic generic installation data, it will also send generic exception error data. So I can see trends among versions etc.  This data is completely transparent to you and can be disabled at any time.  I do not collect and identifiable data only the basics. We will also be putting up a dashboard for users who are nerdy just to see the data mapped out.
 * **FIXED**: Remote Sensor's Fan circulation should now work like it was intended.
 * **FIXED**: Nest Log Out function to actually take you back to auth screen after clearing token.
 * **ADDED**: You can now use Day, Time, Mode filters in most Nest Automations.
 * **ADDED**: View all Apps/Devices state data under diagnostics.
 * **ADDED**: Voice Notifications using Speech or MusicPlayer devices to Contact Automations Events work correctly with contact automation.
 * **ADDED**: App now supports Broadcast message from developer.
 * **NEW**: When updates are available there is a link in the smartapp that takes you directly to the IDE in your mobile browser.
 * **UPDATED**: Tapping on the Nest Manager version app top of page will now take you a Changelog page which displays those changes.
 * **UPDATED**: Lot's of tweaks and fixes for annoying UI bugs and to many subtle changes to list.

***Weather Device:***
 * **Updated** @desertblade remodeled the design to allow for modal popups for weather alerts, and forecast data.

## Things to Know
 * __This is still technically in still in post-BETA so you may experience issues!!!__
 * This app ***DOES NOT*** support Nest Cams **currently** mainly because I don't have any to test
 * Each install of this SmartApp will only support **One** location/structure and the Thermostats and Protects within
 * This version uses a new token which when we are ready to support it will allow access to Nest cams without needing to completely re-install everything. 
 * _The token used with this application is using my 'Works for Nest' distribution *appId* and *secret*.  It's an older one which allows 1000 individual user logins before I will need to certify with Nest._
 __I do not have the ability to see any of your data or who is even using the token__
 * Devices that use html tile will not refresh with going out of the device and back in again.
 
 *  ***There were a ton of changes to the core code so we can't guarantee there won't issue updating the code directly.  Once you update it is important that you open the smart app and press done to clean up old variables and switch to the new Cron scheduler.  If you have any issues after that I suggest you remove the old devices from any apps or routines they are under. Then remove the nest manager smartapp and start over.***


## Advantages
 * Able to add/remove multiples devices from a single SmartApp
 * No need to many enter device serial number and login info in preferences
 * Nest Login info is not stored by the application
 * No need to use 3rd Party Polling apps for device updates
 * One single API call for all Nest devices
 * Since there is only a single poll for all devices, updates are more often
 * The devices look great :smile:

## 3rd-Party SmartApp Compatibility (Confirmed)

## Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issues
*If you are experiencing any issues, please let us know by heading over to projects issues page on GitHub. If you don't see the issue reported please help open an new one and provide as much detail as you can.*

**[Project Issues Link](https://github.com/tonesto7/st-nest-unofficial/issues)** 

In an effort to make it easier for some of you troubleshoot without having to use the IDE constantly.  I have added in a diagnostic option under the preference section of the SmartApp.  
Once this is enabled it will begin to store non-user identifiable error logs from the app and store in a local state variable of the app.  
This feature will help you to view and export the logs (*also see the tip below*) directly from the Smart App. This also allows you to copy & paste them into the issues form on GitHub.

**Tip:** If you enable diagnostic logs in the app you can share the logs from with in the app you can store the direct link to log JSON file on you computer and browse directly to the log everytime you need to review the errors.

### Troubleshooting
**Tip:** *The most common issue is forgetting to enable oAuth for the app under SmartThings*
